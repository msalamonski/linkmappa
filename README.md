Open Street Maps API - points from open nyc data database 
We are linking garbage, the locations of all the garbage cans of NYC, and wherever you can find your local garbage can. 

linkMappa is an appa that links your crappa. Most New Yorkers throw their trash on the streets because they can't find a garbage can nearby. Our web app solves this problem by showing you the closest garbage can, so that you can get rid of your trash ethically.

Okay, for real this time: (rough draft)

# linkMappa

Trash and litter has always been a problem for such a big urban place as New York City. A lot of people throw their rubbish onto the street, instead of holding onto it until they reach a garbage recepticle. We now have a potential solution to this problem, and that is with our app, linkMappa! Now people can glance at their phones and find the closest garbage can near them. This even makes throwing out trash fun, as you are sort of 'trash can hunting'.

The app is simple, it pinpoints all the garbage cans on the map of New York City. It does this by taking NYC's open database and putting it in as map markers in Open Street Maps / Open Layers.
